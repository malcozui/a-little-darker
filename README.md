## This is *A Little Darker*

A theme created by me, *malcozui*, I created this theme since I wanted something a little darker than most themes you find, but not so dark that its a high contrast theme.

The theme is a fork of the *Default Dark+* theme that comes packaged with Visual Studio Code, but with the exception that all backgrounds are darker, so it's more visually appealing to look at as well as easier to use ini low light scenario's such as night-time. There also come's packaged with the theme set a *Pink 'n Purple* theme which is also a dark theme, but is monochromatic as it uses almost exclusively shades of pink and purple for any and all keywords.

## Source code

The source code for the theme is available here: on [Github](https://github.com/malcozui/a-little-darker).
