## This is *A Little Darker*

A theme created by me, *malcozui*, I created this theme since I wanted something a little darker than most themes you find, but not so dark that its a high contrast theme.

The theme is a fork of the *Default Dark+* theme that comes packaged with Visual Studio Code, but with most keywords all shifted to be a shade of pink and purple, and with all the background colours darkened so that it's more pleasant to look at for long periods of time.

## Source code

The source code for the theme is available here: on [Github](https://github.com/malcozui/a-little-darker).
It was generated using yo generator-code and thus you should seek the `A Little Darker-color-theme.json` file for all colour choices and token assignment.
